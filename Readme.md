# Safe MEGA

A static web application which add passwords to folder links.

~~[Example folder](https://safeme.ga/#tIAGnDCY) (the password is [her name](http://myanimelist.net/character/7373) lowercased).~~

**WARNING: THIS TOOL STOPPED WORKING!**

Seems that MEGA did some changes in their servers making harder to put passwords
in folders with this tool. Old folders with passwords stopped working. I think the reason
for that is because they want this feature to be a PRO-only feature.

I don't like they making a security feature being paid if it only requires changes in
the client, so I will release a new version of Safe MEGA that solves this problem.
